            <h2>
            Fees and Payment: Paid Services.
            </h2>
            <p>Some portions of the GPSPL Service may have fees associated with them (each, a ‘Paid Service’). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the GPSPL Service at any time.</p>
            <p className="mt-4"> <span className="font-bold">Free Trial.</span> GPSPL may make available a free trial for a Paid Service without charge to you (“Free Trial”). You may be required to enter a Payment Method (defined below) in order to register for a Free Trial. The applicable Paid Service will automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in accordance with Section 4(d), at the end of the Free Trial unless you log into your GPSPL account and cancel the Paid Service before the end of the Free Trial. You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your GPSPL Service account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize GPSPL or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you (‘Payment Method’), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:Your <span className="font-bold"> ‘Subscription Billing Date’</span> is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th:</p>
            <div className="ml-8">
            <p>1. your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month,  </p>
            <p>2. your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and</p>
            <p>3. your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable.</p>
            </div>
            <p className="mt-4">For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the Subscription Billing Date for that month).For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period’s (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to GPSPL may be shared by GPSPL with companies who work on behalf of GPSPL such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to GPSPL and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your GPSPL account upon demand, (ii) GPSPL may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) GPSPL reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more GPSPL Services or your account with GPSPL. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the GPSPL Service before termination.Any fees charged to your account are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms. You agree to submit any dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to GPSPL within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of GPSPL.You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the GPSPL Services, including sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to GPSPL the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that GPSPL is obligated to collect such taxes, GPSPL will charge your Payment Method or otherwise add the applicable to your billing account.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Arbitration Agreement; Governing Law:</h2>
              <p>Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and GPSPL in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and GPSPL agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and GPSPL are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Exceptions. You and GPSPL agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.Arbitration. In the event that the dispute is not resolved pursuant to mediation, such dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (the “SIAC”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference to this paragraph. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman of the SIAC and the official language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>
          
            <p className="mt-4">No Class Actions. YOU AND GPSPL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and GPSPL agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Enforceability. If only Subsection (f) of this arbitration agreement provision, or the entirety of this arbitration agreement provision, is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration agreement provision will be void and, in that case, you and GPSPL both agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and GPSPL agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of Singapore.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Miscellaneous:</h2>
            <p>GPSPL may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by email, regular mail or postings on the GPSPL Service. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless GPSPL is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the GPSPL Service. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notice posted on the GPSPL Service is deemed given 30 days following the initial posting. The failure of GPSPL to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by GPSPL. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by GPSPL without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including Sections 1 through 7, and 10 through 21. Heading references are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy. and any other agreements incorporated by reference, are the entire agreement between you and GPSPL relating to the subject matter described in these Terms and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by GPSPL as set forth above.

OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
