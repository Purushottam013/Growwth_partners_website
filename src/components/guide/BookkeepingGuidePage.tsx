          <div className="prose max-w-none mb-6">
            <p>This refers to systematically recording, organising and maintaining all financial transactions of a company so that they may reflect sales, purchases, and income. The main aim is usually accuracy and currency accessibility.</p>

            <p className="font-semibold">Pro-tip:</p>
            <p>Keep all receipts and invoices organised to simplify your bookkeeping process. An organised system ensures that every transaction has got its proper record. Not only does this make work easier but also provides necessary supporting documents for audits or tax returns filing.</p>

        <section className="max-w-4xl mx-auto my-12">
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Methods of Bookkeeping</h3>
          <div className="prose max-w-none">
            <p>Everything done financially in any institution, whether positive or negative, must be documented accurately for the purpose of reporting and analysis. There are two major types: single-entry & double-entry book keeping systems.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Single-Entry Bookkeeping</h4>
            <p>In single-entry bookkeeping, each transaction gets recorded once. This is almost like using a personal cheque book, which keeps track of the cash flow only. As it indicates the financial position on a limited level, it is useful only where the number of transactions conducted are minimal. It is thus suitable for an individual incurring expenses on behalf of the company or for small businesses.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Double-Entry Bookkeeping</h4>
            <p>Double-entry bookkeeping is where every transaction affects at least two accounts, hence ensuring maintenance of the balance sheet equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity). Although more complicated than the single-entry system, the double-entry bookkeeping method offers detailed statements and greater precision about what happened within a certain time frame. It is thus widely preferred by most businesses.</p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Legal Compliance</h4>
            <p>Through proper bookkeeping, business owners can comply with tax laws and other statutory regulations, thus avoiding penalties that may arise out of non-compliance. This also helps during audits, if there is a need to settle any disputed figures concerning income earned or deductions made as per law.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Financial Management</h4>
            <p>Bookkeeping gives an insight into one's financial status which assists in budgeting, controlling costs, planning investments, and more. It shows where money comes from, how it was used, where it went, so that future goals can be not just planned, but also achieved.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Comprehensive Steps in Bookkeeping Process</h3>
          <div className="prose max-w-none">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Analysing Financial Transactions</h4>
            <p>The first step in the accounting cycle is to understand what each transaction means and how it affects the financial statements. This involves correctly classifying transactions so that they can be reported accurately.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Recording Transactions</h4>
            <p>Transactions are initially recorded in a journal using a general entry, which includes details such as date, account title, description, and amount. Accurate records need to be maintained for future reference and audit purposes.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Posting to the Ledger</h4>
            <p>These journal entries are then transferred into their respective accounts in the general ledger. This process groups all similar information together, making it easier for companies to prepare financial statements later on.</p>
          </div>
          
          <img

            className="w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto my-8 rounded-lg shadow-md"
          />
          
          <div className="prose max-w-none">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Preparing Trial Balance</h4>
            <p>At this stage, one must ensure everything has been entered correctly and that debits equal credits. The trial balance acts as a self-check mechanism before finalising the financial reports like balance sheets and income statements.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Adjusting Entries</h4>
            <p>At the end of an accounting period, to reflect accurate financial positions, entries are often looked into and adjusted. This step could involve correcting errors made while recording transactions or recognising accrued expenses or revenues that were not captured during the initial recognition phase.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Preparing Financial Statements</h4>
            <p>Then comes creating different types of financial statements,â€”balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statementsâ€”which summarise the company's performance over certain time periods, like months, quarters or years. These statements help with decision-making and offer information about the company's financial situation.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Closing the Books</h4>
            <p>At the conclusion of the accounting period, close any temporary accounts so that the following period can begin anew. By using this procedure, income and expenses are guaranteed to be reported within the accurate accounting period.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 my-6">
            <p className="font-semibold">Pro-tip:</p>
            <p>To stay on top of your business' finances, have a detailed checklist of the important tasks to ensure nothing important gets missed. This checklist can provide structure & discipline around key activities like invoice creation, expense tracking, reconciliation and more.</p>
